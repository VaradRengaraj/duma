TODO items (possibly obsolete, listed by general priority):
===========================================================

-Move TODO items to issue tracker

-Linux symbol support

-prevent inclusion of duma_sem.h from outside duma headers

-memccpy(), bcopy() + test for all overloaded string functions

-Interface to cause verification walk

-implement a list structure over pages rather than an array for all slots.
  this would save copying all slot entries, when list grows

-store __func__ additionally to __FILE__ and __LINE__
 depends on storing full filename (not just pointer) in slot

-config for
 long int sysconf (int parameter)  	Function
  This function is used to inquire about runtime system parameters. The 
  parameter argument should be one of the _SC_ symbols listed below.
  The normal return value from sysconf is the value you requested. A value
  of -1 is returned both if the implementation does not impose a limit, and
  in case of an error.
  The following errno error conditions are defined for this function:
  EINVAL           The value of the parameter is invalid.
  enums:
    _SC_PAGESIZE     Inquire about the virtual memory page size of the machine. 
              getpagesize returns the same value (see Query Memory Parameters).
    _SC_PHYS_PAGES   Inquire about the number of physical pages in the system.
    _SC_AVPHYS_PAGES Inquire about the number of available physical pages in
              the system.

-config for The ulimit Function:
  The ulimit function can be used to get and set certain process limits.
    #include <ulimit.h>
    long ulimit (int cmd, /* long newlimit */...);
    Returns: the value of the requested limit if OK, -1 on error
  The ulimit function allows a process to get or set some of its limits. The 
  operation performed is determined by the value of the cmd argument, which 
  must be one of the following four values:
    UL_GMEMLIM This returns the maximum amount of memory the process may use.
  On successful completion, the requested limit is returned. Otherwise, -1 is 
  returned and the limit is not changed.
